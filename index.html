    <p>This lab is established as a funded project by Science & Technology Development Fund (STDF), Ministry of Scientific Research. This project intended to establish a Laboratory for “Human Centered Mechatronics” at Ain Shams University to be the first interdisciplinary research Lab targets “translational research” in Egypt. This research Lab applies the findings from basic science, mechatronic, and state-of-the-art trends in rehabilitation and assistive technologies to enhance human health and well-being. This interdisciplinary research Lab will be setup in collaboration between academic staff from Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Medicine from different departments aiming to design and develop integrated solutions to support patients and rehabilitate people with disabilities, special needs and motor impairment and translate these solutions into medical practice. These solutions will be developed using the state-of-the-art technologies and mechatronic design approaches to overcome the current limitations with traditional approaches in rehabilitation and assistive devices. The approach of using mechatronics to enhance human functionality, mobility and compensate or restore the loss of human physiological functions is known as Biomechatronics. This research Lab is applying the concept of biomechatronic by synergistically integrating biology with the components to offer new generations of rehabilitation and assistive technologies.</p>
    <p>Address: 1st Floor, Academic Institute for Heart Surgery, Ain Shams University Teaching Hospitals, Ramsis Street, Cairo, Egypt.</p>
